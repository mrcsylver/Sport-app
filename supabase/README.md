# The database

`schema.sql` is the whole thing: paste it into the Supabase SQL editor, press
RUN, and you have a working database. It drops everything first, so running it
twice is a rebuild, not a mess — and running it on a live database wipes it.

`bounty-pool.sql` is a migration for a database that is already running. It
only adds; nothing logged is touched, and it is safe to run twice.

`fix-this-week.sql` is a one-off. Running `bounty-pool.sql` mid-week changed
which quest the week was for, and because bounty points are worked out on read
rather than stored, anybody who had already finished the old one lost the
points for it. This pins the week back to the quest it started with. The
migration now does the same thing on its own, so it only matters if you ran it
before that was fixed.

## Testing it for real

```bash
supabase/test/run.sh
```

This starts a throwaway Postgres, builds the database from `schema.sql`,
exercises the bounty system, then applies the migration three times to a
database wound back to look like the live one.

It is worth having because parsing SQL proves almost nothing. Two real bugs
survived months of `pglast` checks and were both found the first time the file
was actually executed:

- `log_workout` declared four parameters and its body used six. Gym scoring
  worked in production only because the live database had a newer version
  applied by hand — a rebuild from this file produced a function that could
  not score a lift.
- `revoke all on function public.is_rest_day()` named a signature that does
  not exist (a default argument does not create a second one), so the run
  stopped there and the revoke never applied.

Both are fixed. The suite exists so the next one is found here.

## What is generated

Do not hand-edit these:

| file | written by |
|---|---|
| the `exercises` seed in `schema.sql` | `tools/build_exercises.py` |
| the `bounties` seed in `schema.sql` | `tools/build_bounties.py` |
| `bounty-pool.sql` | `tools/build_bounties.py` |

`build_bounties.py` validates before it writes: every exercise a bounty names
must exist, and must be loggable in the mode the bounty asks for. It has
already caught six quests that nobody could have completed — a three-minute
plank asked for seconds, and plank is only logged in minutes.

The migration is not written by hand either. Every function in it is lifted
out of `schema.sql`, which is the one definition of each, because two
hand-kept copies of a hundred-line function drift and the drift is always
found in production. `tools/sqllift.py` does the lifting; the generator only
says which objects it needs.

One rule the migration follows: **a week already being played keeps the quest
it started with.** Changing the rotation under people mid-week silently takes
away points they had already earned, because the points are derived. The
migration pins the current week to whatever the old rotation gave it, and only
when somebody has actually logged that week.

## Why `check_function_bodies` is off

The first thing `schema.sql` does is `set check_function_bodies = off`. These
functions call each other in both directions, and Postgres resolves a SQL
function body the moment the function is created — so a strict run stops at
the first forward reference, and the file would only work if it were sorted
into an order no human could maintain. Every body is still parsed, so a typo
is still an error; only name resolution is deferred.
